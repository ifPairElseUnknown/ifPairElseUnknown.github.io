# Day 01:
__Hello World!__
Today marks the first day of [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) 2017. 
We woke up 6am, to a chilly Melbourne morning of 8 degrees celsius, in order to get our kids off to childcare and into the [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com) Melbourne CBD office by 9am.

We were warmly greeted by one of our coaches [Adel Smee](https://twitter.com/adelsmee), who settled us in and introduced us to some of the Zendesk team.

In the morning, we participated in a 30min Meditation session, which was an fantastic way to start off RGSoC. Meditation helps manage stress, aids in focus and aligns well with our project [ifme](www.if-me.org).

We had lunch with Adel Smee and [Adam Rice](www.twitter.com/HashNotAdam) to kick off our first day and mark the occasion at [YUZU](https://www.zomato.com/melbourne/yuzu-at-church-lane-collins-street).
After lunch [Simon Hilderbrandt](https://au.linkedin.com/in/simonhildebrandt) stopped by to assist us with setting up our [daily logs](https://ifpairelseunknown.github.io/).
